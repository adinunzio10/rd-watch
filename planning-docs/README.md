# Planning Documentation

This directory contains planning mode outputs from Claude Code for major changes and feature implementations.

## Purpose

The planning-docs directory serves as a structured approach to complex development tasks:

1. **Planning Mode**: Claude Code uses planning mode for major changes
2. **Plan Storage**: All plans are saved here for reference and iteration
3. **Version Control**: Plans are tracked in git for historical reference
4. **Collaboration**: Plans can be reviewed before implementation

## Workflow

### Using Planning Mode

1. **Trigger Planning**: Ask Claude Code to use planning mode for complex tasks
2. **Plan Generation**: Claude creates detailed implementation plans
3. **Plan Review**: Review and provide feedback on the plan
4. **Plan Approval**: Approve the plan to begin implementation
5. **Plan Updates**: Update plans as requirements change

### File Organization

Plans are organized by:
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD format for chronological ordering
- **Feature**: Brief description of the planned feature
- **Status**: Current status (draft, approved, completed, abandoned)

### Naming Convention

```

```

## Plan Template

Each plan should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Plan Title

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Status**: Draft/Approved/In Progress/Completed/Abandoned  
**Estimated Effort**: X hours/days  
**Priority**: High/Medium/Low

## Overview
Brief description of what this plan accomplishes.

## Requirements
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Constraints and assumptions

## Implementation Steps
1. Step 1 with details
2. Step 2 with details
3. Step 3 with details

## Technical Considerations
- Architecture impacts
- Dependencies required
- Testing strategy

## Risk Assessment
- Potential issues
- Mitigation strategies
- Rollback plans

## Success Criteria
- How to measure completion
- Acceptance criteria
- Testing requirements

## Updates
- Date: What changed and why
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use Planning Mode

Use planning mode for:
- **Complex Features**: Multi-step implementations
- **Architecture Changes**: Significant structural modifications
- **Integration Work**: External API integrations
- **Performance Optimization**: Major performance improvements
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing setup

### When NOT to Use Planning Mode

Avoid planning mode for:
- **Simple Bug Fixes**: Single-file modifications
- **Minor Updates**: Configuration changes
- **Documentation**: Non-code changes
- **Quick Experiments**: Proof-of-concept work

### Plan Maintenance

1. **Keep Plans Current**: Update plans as requirements change
2. **Archive Completed Plans**: Move finished plans to archived/
3. **Reference Previous Plans**: Learn from past implementations
4. **Version Control**: Always commit plans to git

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Task Master Integration

Plans integrate with Task Master AI:
- Plans can be converted to Task Master tasks
- Subtasks can reference specific plan sections
- Progress tracking aligns with plan milestones

### Git Integration

Plans follow git workflow:
- Create feature branches for plan implementation
- Reference plan files in commit messages
- Update plans based on implementation learnings

### Documentation Updates

Plans trigger documentation updates:
- Architecture changes update CLAUDE-architecture.md
- Testing plans update claude-tests.md
- Workflow changes update claude-workflows.md

## Example Plans

### Sample Plan Structure

See the current Claude Code optimization as an example of proper planning:

1. **Clear Problem Statement**: Context overhead from large CLAUDE.md
2. **Specific Solution**: Modular documentation system
3. **Implementation Steps**: Ordered list of concrete actions
4. **Success Metrics**: Measurable improvements (90% context reduction)

## Maintenance

This directory is automatically maintained by Claude Code:
- New plans are added as they're created
- Plans are updated as implementations progress
- Completed plans are archived appropriately
- README is updated with new best practices

## Notes

- Plans are living documents - update them as you learn
- Failed experiments are valuable - document what didn't work
- Plans can be iterative - multiple versions are acceptable
- Always include rollback strategies for risky changes
