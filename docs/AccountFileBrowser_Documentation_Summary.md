- **TV-Optimized Components**: Custom focus indicators and D-pad navigation
- **Testing Patterns**: ViewModel and Repository testing examples

#### 5. Updated Directory Structure
- Complete file organization showing the modular AccountFileBrowser system
- Clear separation of concerns across UI, business logic, and data layers
- Integration with existing app architecture

## Key Architecture Features Documented

### 1. Reactive Data Flow
```
UI (Compose) → ViewModel (StateFlow) → Repository (Flow) → API Service
```

### 2. TV-Specific Optimizations
- Custom focus management components
- D-pad navigation patterns
- Bulk selection with long-press support
- TV-friendly visual hierarchy

### 3. Error Handling Strategy
- Typed Result wrapper for API responses
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Clear user feedback with actionable suggestions

### 4. Caching and Performance
- Multi-layer caching strategy
- Pagination for large file lists
- Efficient UI updates with reactive streams

## Development Patterns Documented

### 1. Adding New Features
- Follow established MVVM patterns
- Implement proper TV focus management
- Use reactive state management
- Add comprehensive error handling

### 2. Testing Strategy
- ViewModel testing with mocked repositories
- Repository testing with mocked API services
- UI testing with Compose testing framework

### 3. Integration Guidelines
- Navigation setup with type-safe routes
- Dependency injection with Hilt modules
- API service integration patterns

## Maintenance Guidelines

### For Future Developers

1. **When Adding UI Components**:
   - Follow TV-optimized design patterns documented in usage examples
   - Implement proper focus management with TVFocusIndicator
   - Test with D-pad navigation on actual TV devices

2. **When Modifying State Management**:
   - Update FileBrowserState model as needed
   - Document new event types in FileBrowserEvents
   - Maintain reactive patterns with StateFlow/SharedFlow

3. **When Adding API Integration**:
   - Follow repository pattern with Result wrapper
   - Implement caching strategy for performance
   - Add proper error handling and recovery

4. **When Writing Tests**:
   - Use documented testing patterns for consistency
   - Mock external dependencies appropriately
   - Test TV-specific interactions and focus behavior
