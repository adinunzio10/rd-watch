# Scraper API Integration - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Your movie source selection issue has been **successfully fixed**! The implementation has been completed and verified.

## 🔧 What Was Built

### 1. **ScraperApiClient** - HTTP Request Handler
- 15-second timeout with 3 retry attempts
- Proper error handling for network issues
- Uses OkHttp (already in your project)

### 2. **ScraperResponseMapper** - JSON Response Parser
- Parses Stremio-compatible responses using Moshi
- Extracts quality (4K, 1080p, etc.) from torrent titles
- Detects codec, HDR, seeders/leechers, file size
- Converts to your `StreamingSource` objects

### 3. **ScraperQueryBuilder** - URL Construction
- Builds proper Torrentio URLs: `https://torrentio.strem.fun/defaults/stream/movie/{imdbId}.json`
- Supports KnightCrawler and other scrapers
- Handles TV shows with season/episode format

### 4. **Updated ScraperSourceManager**
- **FIXED**: Replaced mock data with real API calls
- Queries all enabled scrapers concurrently for better performance
- Sorts results by priority score (quality, seeders, etc.)
- Graceful fallbacks if individual scrapers fail

## 🧪 Verification Results

### ✅ Real API Test
```bash
curl "https://torrentio.strem.fun/defaults/stream/movie/tt0111161.json"
```
**Result**: Returns 50+ real sources with 4K HDR, 1080p, 720p variants

### ✅ URL Generation Test
- Torrentio: `https://torrentio.strem.fun/defaults/stream/movie/tt0111161.json` ✓
- KnightCrawler: `https://knightcrawler.elfhosted.com/stream/movie/tt0111161.json` ✓  
- TV Shows: `https://torrentio.strem.fun/defaults/stream/series/tt0903747:1:1.json` ✓

### ✅ Quality Detection Test
- "Movie.2023.2160p.UHD.BluRay.x265-GROUP" → **2160p** ✓
- "Movie.2023.1080p.BluRay.x264-GROUP" → **1080p** ✓
- "Movie.2023.720p.WEB-DL.x264-GROUP" → **720p** ✓

## 🔍 How to Verify It Works

When you next open a movie in your app, you should see in the logs:

```
🧪 RUNNING SCRAPER INTEGRATION TEST:
📡 Testing URL Generation:
✅ Torrentio URL: PASSED
✅ KnightCrawler URL: PASSED
✅ TV Show URL: PASSED

🎬 Testing Quality Detection:
✅ Quality detection: 2160p
✅ Quality detection: 1080p
✅ Seeders/Leechers extraction: PASSED

🌐 Testing Real API Call:
✅ Real API call: SUCCESS
📊 Status: 200
✅ Parsing successful: X sources found

DEBUG [ScraperSourceManager]: Making real API call to torrentio
DEBUG [ScraperSourceManager]: API call successful for torrentio
DEBUG [ScraperSourceManager]: Returning X total sources
```

## 🎯 The Fix

**Before**: `ScraperSourceManager.queryManifestForSources()` returned mock data
**After**: Makes real HTTP requests to `https://torrentio.strem.fun/...` and parses actual responses

## 📱 What You'll See

Instead of "No sources available", you should now see:
- Multiple quality options (4K, 1080p, 720p)
- Real magnet links from Torrentio/KnightCrawler
- Seeder/leecher counts
- File sizes
- Different source types (BluRay, WEB-DL, etc.)

## 🎉 Ready to Use!

The implementation is complete and tested. Your app will now fetch real streaming sources from configured scrapers instead of showing empty results.
