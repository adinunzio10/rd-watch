What is our next task?

**Get Task from Task Master:**
```bash
task-master next
```

**Analyze Complexity & Strategy:**
Based on Task Master complexity score (check .taskmaster/reports/task-complexity-report.json):

- **Complexity 1-3**: Single agent (sequential implementation)
- **Complexity 4-6**: Domain specialists (2-3 agents, parallel work)  
- **Complexity 7-9**: Full swarm (4+ agents, orchestrated collaboration)

**Specialist Role Assignment:**
Based on task content and dependencies:
- **Architecture Agent**: Data models, DI patterns, MVVM foundation
- **Frontend Agent**: UI/Compose components, TV focus management
- **Backend Agent**: API integration, networking, data persistence
- **Testing Agent**: Test creation and validation (complexity 4+)
- **Integration Agent**: Coordination and conflict resolution (complexity 6+)

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Security**: Authentication, data exposure, permissions
- **Breaking Changes**: API modifications, schema changes, dependency updates
- **Performance**: Memory usage, TV focus management, lazy loading
- **Integration**: Dependencies on completed tasks (check task.dependencies array)

**Recommended Strategy:**
[Strategy will be determined based on complexity score and task analysis]
